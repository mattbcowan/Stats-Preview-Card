## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I started off by reviewing the style guide. While looking through that I pulled all the colors, fonts, font sizes and media queries into a CSS file for use later. After that I grabbed the fonts from Google Fonts and imported them into the HTML so we had everything from the style guide ready to go.

I set my CSS file up for a mobile first approach to make life easier. After that I hopped over to the HTML to clean it up and get items into their own sections. I pulled in the photos via the photos tag so that it could switch between mobile version and desktop while still keeping all the data needed for accessibility needs.

After all of that it was time to move on with the actual CSS. I focused on the mobile version first and got all the styles added to the elements. Starting from the top down I adjusted the pieces to be as close to the JPEGs as possible. For the desktop layout it was just a couple of CSS changes in order to get it looking right. Job done.
